Developed a deep learning model to classify various tomato plant diseases from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

Collected and preprocessed a dataset of tomato leaf images, including healthy and diseased samples. Implemented a custom CNN architecture in TensorFlow and achieved high accuracy in disease detection.

This project aimed to aid farmers in early identification and treatment of plant diseases, potentially increasing crop yield and quality.
