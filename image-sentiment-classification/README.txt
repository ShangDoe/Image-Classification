Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images based on sentiment (happy or sad). 

Collected and labeled a diverse dataset of images reflecting happy and sad sentiments. 

Implemented the model using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving accurate classification results. 

This project demonstrates the ability to interpret and classify emotional content in images, which can be applied in fields such as social media analysis and user experience research.
