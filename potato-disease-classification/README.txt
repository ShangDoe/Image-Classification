Created a deep learning model to identify different potato plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

Developed a dataset of potato leaf images with labels for various diseases such as late blight and early blight. 

The custom CNN architecture implemented in TensorFlow successfully detected diseases, providing an accurate and efficient solution for early disease detection and prevention in potato farming.

Classes:
1) Early Blight
2) Healthy 
3) Late Blight
